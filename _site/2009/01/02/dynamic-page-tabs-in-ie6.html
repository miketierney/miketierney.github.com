<h2>Dynamic Page Tabs in IE6</h2>

<p><em><em>Note:</em> This is a re-posting/summary of a post that was written and released on the <a href="http://onehub.com/blog" title="Onehub Blog">Onehub blog</a>; I'm just posting up a snippet so that you can see what it's about. If you want to read the full text, please visit: <a href="http://www.onehub.com/past/2009/1/2/dynamic_page_tabs_in_ie6" title="Dynamic Page Tabs in IE6">http://www.onehub.com/past/2009/1/2/dynamic_page_tabs_in_ie6/</a></em></p>

<p>While working to ensure that the Onehub experience was of the best possible quality for our Internet Explorer 6 users, I ran in to a unique challenge: we have page tabs that need to be completely flexible. I had no guarantee that they would be a certain width, height, or even how many tabs there would be.</p>

<p>Anyone who has worked with IE6 for long enough will know what a headache scenario that can be, but I needed to make sure that these tabs were as usable in IE6 as they were in any other browser. After doing no small amount of research, I realized that very few people have written about how they have solved this problem; in fact, I found very few examples of tabs that were as complex as ours were. So, I had to solve the problem for myself, and this is what I did.</p>
