Not too long ago, I released a Ruby <a href="http://github.com/panpainter/featherdust/tree/master">gem on GitHub</a>.  You can read more about it over at the <a href="http://featherdust.panpainter.com">gem's site</a>, but in a nutshell it's a gem that's designed to be added in to your website, and it will aggregate however many status updates you want from your Twitter account.  It works similarly to many of the javascript Twitter aggregators, except that it doesn't require the end user to have Javascript installed.
