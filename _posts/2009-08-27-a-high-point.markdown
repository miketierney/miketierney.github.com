## {{ page.title }}

Last weekend I participated in [Rails Rumble '09](http://r09.railsrumble.com) (along with some [really](http://twitter.com/WanderingMatt) [awesome](http://twitter.com/texel) [teammates](http://twitter.com/waloeiii)), and today we found out that we made it in to the Public Voting stage!

It really makes that weekend of hard work worth it (although we all really wanted to build [Quippopotamus](http://quippopotam.us) anyway). Congrats to my teammates, and to everyone else - go vote for us! :)

You'll also notice that I've added something new to the sidebar (over there on the right) &ndash; that would be the by-product of last weekend's endeavors, an embedded widget from [Quippopotamus](http://quippopotam.us) cycling through a collection of quips that I've started to build.
