title: Dynamic Page Tabs in IE6
excerpt: While working to ensure that the Onehub experience was of the best possible quality for our Internet Explorer 6 users, I ran in to a unique challenge: we have page tabs that need to be completely flexible.

So, I had to solve the problem for myself, and this is what I did.
