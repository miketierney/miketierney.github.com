excerpt: A bundle for TextMate designed to make creating HTML documents that work with the 960.gs CSS framework much easier.

As part of the work I do every day, I use the [960.gs](http://960.gs) CSS framework, which means I spend a good portion of my day typing things like "grid_4" and "container_16" and "alpha" or "omega" a LOT.

### This is stupid. ###

So I created a 960.gs Bundle for [TextMate](http://macromates.com). Now, this doesn't help with the CSS side of things (it won't keep you from typing in `.grid_4` for example), because there's already a [bundle that does that](http://github.com/adamstac/960-grid-system-textmate-bundle) (and I did model some of my snippet structure off of his, so credit where credit's due). I recommend installing both, since that Bundle also handles HAML (and, again, mine does not &ndash; just the HTML).

If you want to download it, you can grab it from [here](http://panpainter.com/downloads/960_gs.tmbundle.zip) or you can [grab the code from Github](http://github.com/panpainter/960_gs.tmbundle).

Also, if there are any problems that you run in to while using it (or if you have a request), please [let me know](http://github.com/panpainter/960_gs.tmbundle/issues)! I'll happily update the bundle.
