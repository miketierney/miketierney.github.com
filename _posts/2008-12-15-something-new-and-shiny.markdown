Just to keep everyone in the loop; I'm in the process of working on a Ruby gem that will be released in the next week or so on RubyForge. When there's more to know, I'll post it here. Â Or, you can keep an eye on<a title="The project's homepage" href="http://featherdust.panpainter.com">The project's site</a> (not much there now, of course).

This is being released as a part of the UW course that I'm taking focusing on Ruby, but is something that I plan on maintaining well after the course is over.
