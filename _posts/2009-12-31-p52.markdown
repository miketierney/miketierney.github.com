One of the things I've had on my to-do list for quite some time now is to spend more time writing (just look at my archives and you'll see what I mean - I think I've been averaging one post per month, and that's been an active couple of months for me!).

It's not like I don't have anything to say, but I get so stuck inside my own head that I never end up actually writing anything, and unfortunately that just makes it look like I have nothing to actually say. Which is bad.

### Project 52

So, in an attempt to meet this goal, I'm participating in [Project 52](http://project52.info). The goal is simple: write one blog post per week. If you fail, then there are over 400 people that will know. It's a bit scary, but I'm hoping that it will provide the motivation that I need in order to actually get writing.

I'll be writing on all sorts of topics, because I'm fascinated by a wide assortment of things. I  will continue, of course, to use [twitter](http://twitter.com/panpainter) for the more stream-of-consciousness type posts, and my [tumblr](http://tumble.panpainter.com) site will continue to hold the things I find around the web that interest me, but this site will be the meat of all that content. 

Here's to new directions in 2010! I have high hopes that it'll be a good year, and that this project will produce at least a few valuable posts.
